### Overview:
The prestigious company operates its business in various regions across the world. The company stakeholders want customers and sales analytics to know some insights for the last few years so that they can make useful decisions about customers services and, obviously, enhance sales.

### Objective:
To create comprehensive customers and sales analysis dashboards analyzing previous data to gain actionable insights to evaluate AW customers appearance and sales operations.

### Steps:
1. Import datasets (10 tables) to Power BI
2. Data Processing & Transformation
3. Data Modelling & DAX Measures
4. Design Dashboards & Insights

### Customers Analysis: 
I built an extensive customers analytics dashboard where stakeholders will find:
1.	**KPIs:** Total Customer, Average Annual Income & Average Age.
2.	**Filters:** Year, Education, Gender, Annual Income, Occupation, Home Owner & Marital Status.
3.	Number of Orders by Customer Name (Top & Bottom Customers).
4.	Number of Customers by Education, Gender, Children, Annual Income, and Age.
5.	Customers Country Identification Map.

### Sales Analysis: 
I also built an extensive sales analytics dashboard based on previous sales data.
1.	**KPIs:** Total Order, Quantity Sold, Quantity Returned, Return Rate & Total Revenue.
2.	**Filters:** Year & Country.
3.	Order Quantity by Product Name (Top & Bottom Products).
4.	Revenue by Month Name (Sales Trend).
5.	Return Quantity by Product Name (Top & Bottom Products).
6.	Order Quantity by Country and Continent.

### Key Insights: 
- Year over year, customers placed more orders.
- 28.99% (highest) customers completed bachelors.
- The average age of the customers is 62.42 years.
- Total 84K product quantity sold, and the return rate is 2.17%.
- Revenue increased year over year.
- The highestâ€“selling product is the 30 oz. water bottle, whereas the lowestâ€“selling product is Mountain-100 Silver, 48.
- The top part of the year (January- June) generated more revenue than the bottom part of the year (July- December).
- United States customers ordered more, whereas France customers ordered less.

### Recommendations: 
- The company stakeholders should plan exciting offers for younger age customers.
- The return rate is low, but there is room for more minimization.
- Lowestâ€“selling products like Mountain-100 Silver, 48 can be given discount offers.
- The bottom part of the year (July- December) needs a better strategy.
- Overall, stakeholders need to refine sales strategy to increase sales and revenue.
